I am a mathematician located in Vietnam. 


I was a Hans Rademacher Instructor in the Department of Mathematics at the 
University of Pennsylvania from 2021-2022. 
Prior to Fall 2021, I was a student of [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) and [Bob Pego](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~bobpego/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am particularly keen on turning real-world phenomena into theorems.
My current research interests include: 

- Quantum foundation
- Diffusion approximations of complex systems 
- Partial differential equations
