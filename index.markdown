I am a Mathematician located in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. 
My day job is to lecture and advise students at Fulbright University Vietnam.
At night, I conduct mathematical research via my
 personal funding, at my home office.

Starting in the Fall of 2025, I will move to [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en) via the 
[VNU350 Project](https://vnu350.vnuhcm.edu.vn/en/) (to attract "Young Talents" and "Top Scholars" 
to go back to Vietnam).


I was a Hans Rademacher Instructor in the Department of Mathematics at the 
University of Pennsylvania from 2021-2022. 
Prior to Fall 2021, I was a student of [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) and [Bob Pego](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~bobpego/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am particularly keen on turning real-world phenomena into theorems.
My current research interests include: 

- Quantum foundation
- Diffusion approximations of complex systems 
- Partial differential equations
